# Caleb I want to make a documentation about your Database crash course in 2018. Can you please create a repo and add me in it so that I can work on it and maybe you can just look at it for 5-10 minutes next week to determine if I have learnt correctly? I don't know if it sounds stupid or not. But create a repo please. 

my mail: javascriptiqbal@gmail.com

there wasn't any other way for me to just get a hold of you. So, just tried to get you in your running project. Here is your video link in which I am working on : https://youtu.be/ztHopE5Wnpc
